pharmacy services are unavailable.

RATIONALE:
The responsible manager, as defined in WAC 246-869-070, of a hospital or free
standing emergency department may, in collaboration with the appropriate medical
staff committee of the hospital, develop policies and procedures in compliance
with RCW 70.41.480 which must be implemented to provide discharge medications to
patients released from hospital emergency departments during hours when
community or outpatient hospital pharmacy services are not available. The
delivery of a single dose for immediate administration to the patient is not
subject to this regulation. Such policies shall allow the practitioner or
registered nurse to distribute medications, pursuant to the policies and
procedures, as specified in RCW 70.41.480 and the following:

---------- ELEMENTS ----------
1. 246.873.060.1 (1)
   An order of a practitioner authorized to prescribe a drug is presented. Oral
or electronically transmitted orders must be verified by the practitioner in
writing within seventy-two hours.

2. 246.873.060.2 (2)
   A department credentialed pharmacy technician or a licensed pharmacist shall
prepackage the medication. Medication prepackaged by a department credentialed
pharmacy technician must be checked by a licensed pharmacist. The prepackaged
medication must contain any supplemental material provided and an affixed label
that contains:
(a) Name, address, and telephone number of the hospital.
(b) The name of the drug (as required by chapter 246-899 WAC), strength and

(e) Directions for use.

3. 246.873.060.3 (3)
   No more than a forty-eight hour supply is provided to the patient except when
the pharmacist has informed appropriate hospital personnel that normal services
will not be available within forty-eight hours. A final quantity of medication
supply shall not exceed ninety-six hours.

4. 246.873.060.4 (4)
   The practitioner or registered nurse will ensure the container is labeled
before presenting to the patient and shows the following:
(a) Name of patient;
(b) Complete directions for use, which should include at a minimum the number of
units distributed, frequency, and route of administration;
(c) Date of distribution;

   The medications distributed as discharge medications must be stored in
compliance with the laws concerning security and access. They must be stored in

for entry into the pharmacy when pharmacy services are not available.
