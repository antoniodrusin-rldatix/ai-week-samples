---------- CHAPTER ----------
Name: DSSE
Title: Supporting Self-Management (DSSE)

OVERVIEW:
One basic principle of disease management mandates that the patient must be
actively involved in managing the disease. Patients who learn about their
disease, their symptoms, and the warning signs of future complications tend to
be better able to manage their long-term health. Practitioners can strive to
offer high-quality care, but their effort will have greater results when
patients are interested and informed. The standards in this chapter focus on the
following: - Assessing patients’ self-management capabilities - Providing
support for patients in self-management activities - Involving patients in
developing the plan of care - Educating patients in the theory and skills
necessary to manage their disease(s) - Recognizing and supporting self-
management efforts

---------- STANDARD ----------
Name: DSSE 02.01.01
Description: The disease-specific care program develops a self-management plan
as part of the individualized plan of care that involves the patient, family,
and staff.

RATIONALE:
A self-management plan is a structured, documented plan that is developed to
support an individual patient's self-management of their condition and describes
how to stay well, how to cope when the condition worsens, and what to do when
problems occur. A self-management plan that involves the patient and family
empowers them to achieve their goals, which also leads to better clinical
quality outcomes.

---------- ELEMENTS ----------
1. DSSE.02.01.01 EP01 (EP 01)
   The disease-specific care program develops an individualized self-management
plan that involves the patient, staff, and family and/or caregiver, who are
included in the patient’s care, treatment, and services.

2. DSSE.02.01.01 EP02 (EP 02)
   The disease-specific care program identifies physical, psychological, and/or
psychosocial barriers that prohibit the patient’s engagement in self-management
activities. The program revises the self-management plan as applicable.
