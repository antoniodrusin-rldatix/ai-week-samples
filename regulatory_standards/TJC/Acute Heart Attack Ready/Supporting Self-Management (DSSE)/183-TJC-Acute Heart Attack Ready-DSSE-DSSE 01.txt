Title: Supporting Self-Management (DSSE)

OVERVIEW:
One basic principle of disease management mandates that the patient must be actively involved in managing the disease. Patients who learn about their disease, their symptoms, and the warning signs of future complications tend to be better able to manage their long-term health. Practitioners can strive to offer high-quality care, but their effort will have greater results when patients are interested and informed. The standards in this chapter focus on the following: - Assessing patientsâ€™ self-management capabilities - Providing support for patients in self-management activities - Involving patients in developing the plan of care - Educating patients in the theory and skills necessary to manage their disease(s) - Recognizing and supporting self-management efforts
