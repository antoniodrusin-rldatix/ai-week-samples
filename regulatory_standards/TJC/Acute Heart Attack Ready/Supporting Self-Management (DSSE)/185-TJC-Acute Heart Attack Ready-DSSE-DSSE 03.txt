---------- CHAPTER ----------
Name: DSSE
Title: Supporting Self-Management (DSSE)

OVERVIEW:
One basic principle of disease management mandates that the patient must be
actively involved in managing the disease. Patients who learn about their
disease, their symptoms, and the warning signs of future complications tend to
be better able to manage their long-term health. Practitioners can strive to
offer high-quality care, but their effort will have greater results when
patients are interested and informed. The standards in this chapter focus on the
following: - Assessing patientsâ€™ self-management capabilities - Providing
support for patients in self-management activities - Involving patients in
developing the plan of care - Educating patients in the theory and skills
necessary to manage their disease(s) - Recognizing and supporting self-
management efforts
