Title: Performance Measurement (DSPM)

OVERVIEW:
Performance improvement (PI) activities should help identify and evaluate
changes that the program must make to enhance performance. Performance
improvement is a continuous process and is dependent on measuring the function
of important processes and services, as well as the final outcomes of the care
rendered. The standards in this chapter focus on the following: - Having an
organized, comprehensive approach to PI - Developing a performance improvement
plan - Trending and comparing data to evaluate processes and outcomes - Using
information garnered from measurement data to improve or validate clinical
practice - Using patient-specific, care-related data - Evaluating the patient's
perception of the quality of care - Maintaining data quality and integrity
