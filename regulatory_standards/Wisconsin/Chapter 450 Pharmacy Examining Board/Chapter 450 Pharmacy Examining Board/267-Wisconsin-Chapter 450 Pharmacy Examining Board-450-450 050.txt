   The board may, upon application and payment of the fee specified in s. 440.05 (2), license as a pharmacist any person who is licensed in another state if the person produces satisfactory evidence of having met requirements comparable to those that existed in this state at the time the person became licensed in the other state. The board may deny a license as a pharmacist under this section to any person whose license to practice pharmacy in another state has been voluntarily surrendered, limited, suspended, or revoked. The board may require an applicant under this section to pass an equivalency examination administered by the board. If the board requires an equivalency examination, any person licensed as a pharmacist in another state who is engaged in the active practice of pharmacy may only be required to pass an examination on state and federal laws, rules, and regulations.
