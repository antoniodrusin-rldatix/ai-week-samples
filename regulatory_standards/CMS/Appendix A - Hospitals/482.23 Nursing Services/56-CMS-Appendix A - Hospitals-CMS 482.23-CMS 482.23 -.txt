ABOUT:
Interpretive Guidelines §482.23 The hospital must have an organized nursing
service and must provide on premise nursing services 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week with at least 1 registered nurse (RN) furnishing or supervising the service
24 hours a day, 7 days a week (Exception: small rural hospitals operating under
a waiver as discussed in §482.23(b)(1)). The Social Security Act (SSA) at
§1861(b) states that nursing services must be furnished to inpatients and
furnished by the hospital. The SSA at §1861(e) further requires that the
hospital have a RN on duty at all times (except small rural hospitals operating
under a nursing waiver). The nursing service must be a well-organized service of
the hospital and under the direction of a registered nurse. The nursing service
must be integrated into the hospital-wide QAPI program. Survey Procedures
§482.23 • Determine if the nursing service is integrated into the hospital-wide
QAPI program. • Interview the director of the service. Request the following
items: - Organizational chart(s) for nursing services for all locations where
the hospital provides nursing services; - Job or position descriptions for all
nursing personnel including the director’s position description. • Select at
least one patient from every inpatient care unit. Observe the nursing care in
progress to determine the adequacy of staffing and to assess the delivery of
care. Other sources of information to use in the evaluation of the nursing
services are: nursing care plans, medical records, patients, family members,
accident and investigative reports, staffing schedules, nursing policies and
procedures, and QAPI activities and reports. Interview patients for information
relative to the delivery of nursing services.
