The nursing service must be a well-organized service of the hospital and under the direction of a registered nurse. The nursing service must be integrated into the hospital-wide QAPI program. Survey Procedures §482.23 • Determine if the nursing service is integrated into the hospital-wide QAPI program. • Interview the director of the service. Request the following items: - Organizational chart(s) for nursing services for all locations where the hospital provides nursing services; - Job or position descriptions for all nursing personnel including the director’s position description. • Select at least one patient from every inpatient care unit. Observe the nursing care in progress to determine the adequacy of staffing and to assess the delivery of care. Other sources of information to use in the evaluation of the nursing services are: nursing care plans, medical records, patients, family members, accident and investigative reports, staffing schedules, nursing policies and procedures, and QAPI activities and reports. Interview patients for information relative to the delivery of nursing services. ______________________________________________________________________
