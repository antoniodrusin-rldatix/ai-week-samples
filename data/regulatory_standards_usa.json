        "overview": "This chapter includes specific certification participation requirements (CPRs) that apply to the certification process and are required to maintain a certification award. These differ from review eligibility criteria in that the certification process may be initiated even when all CPRs have not yet been met. For an organization seeking certification for the first time, compliance with the CPRs is assessed during the initial review. For the certified program, compliance with these requirements is assessed throughout the certification cycle through on-site reviews, Evidence of Standards Compliance (ESC), and periodic updates of organization-specific data and information. Organizations are either compliant or not compliant with CPRs. When an organization does not comply with a CPR, the organization generally will be assigned a Requirement for Improvement (RFI) similar to noncompliance with a standard. However, refusal to permit performance of an unscheduled or unannounced for-cause review (CPR 3) or falsification of information (CPR 7) will immediately lead to a decision of Not Certified. Any RFI can potentially impact the certification decision and follow-up requirements, as determined by established certification decision rules listed in \u201cThe Joint Commission Certification Process\u201c (CERT) chapter. Failure to resolve an RFI has the potential to lead to loss of certification.",

For example, disease management service providers may facilitate or support care by telephone interventions but may not have a physical site where patients are seen or gathered. In these cases, the facility standards may not apply. Each disease-specific care program should consider its individual circumstances and services.",

The Social Security Act (SSA) at \u00a71861(b) states that nursing services must be furnished to inpatients and furnished by the hospital. The SSA at \u00a71861(e) further requires that the hospital have a RN on duty at all times (except small rural hospitals operating under a nursing waiver). The nursing service must be a well-organized service of the hospital and under the direction of a registered nurse. The nursing service must be integrated into the hospital-wide QAPI program. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.23 \u2022 Determine if the nursing service is integrated into the hospital-wide QAPI program. \u2022 Interview the director of the service. Request the following items: - Organizational chart(s) for nursing services for all locations where the hospital provides nursing services; - Job or position descriptions for all nursing personnel including the director\u2019s position description. \u2022 Select at least one patient from every inpatient care unit. Observe the nursing care in progress to determine the adequacy of staffing and to assess the delivery of care. Other sources of information to use in the evaluation of the nursing services are: nursing care plans, medical records, patients, family members, accident and investigative reports, staffing schedules, nursing policies and procedures, and QAPI activities and reports. Interview patients for information relative to the delivery of nursing services. ______________________________________________________________________",

        "about": "Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.25 A hospital must provide pharmaceutical services that meet the needs of its patients.\u00a0 The services must include either a pharmacy that is directed by a pharmacist, or, when appropriate, a drug storage area that is competently supervised.\u00a0 The hospital\u2019s medical staff is responsible for developing pharmaceutical policies and procedures that minimize the potential for medication errors, but may delegate this function to the pharmaceutical service. The manner or degree of noncompliance with the requirements of this Condition and its component standards must be evaluated to determine whether there is substantial noncompliance with the Condition, warranting a Condition-level citation. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.25 What is included in pharmaceutical services? Pharmaceutical services encompass the functions of procuring, storing, compounding, repackaging, and dispensing all medications, biologicals, chemicals and medication-related devices within the hospital.\u00a0 They also include providing medication-related information to care professionals within the hospital, as well as direct provision of medication-related care. Meeting patient needs Hospitals must provide pharmaceutical services that meet the needs of their patients.\u00a0 The scope and complexity of pharmaceutical services available in the hospital must be consistent with the volume and types of patients the hospital serves. Except in unusual circumstances, the pharmaceutical service is expected to make available in a timely manner the volume and types of medications typically needed.\u00a0 These would be those medications typically prescribed by the hospital\u2019s practitioners for hospital patients receiving inpatient services, surgical services, diagnostic services involving medications as a component of testing, and outpatient drug therapies administered while the patient is in the hospital. Not every hospital is expected to offer the same level of pharmaceutical services.\u00a0 For example: \u2022 It would not be uncommon for a psychiatric hospital to maintain a relatively limited pharmaceutical service, due to minimal need for compounding, and/or dispensing multiple types and forms of medications and biologicals. \u2022 On the other hand, a short-term acute care hospital with a busy oncology outpatient service and other complex medical and surgical departments would be expected to provide a wider range of pharmaceutical services that are ready to be furnished when needed. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.25 \u2022 Ask the hospital for evidence of the scope and complexity of its pharmaceutical services. \u2022 Ask how the hospital has determined that the services meet the needs of its patients. \u2022 Ask unit nursing staff if prescribed medications are routinely available and timely.\u00a0 If there are reports of frequent delays or other problems, probe further with the director of pharmaceutical services.",

If a hospital does not have an organized governing body, the persons legally responsible for the conduct of the hospital must carry out the functions specified in this part that pertain to the governing body.",
        "about": "Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.12 The hospital must have a governing body which is effective in carrying out its responsibilities for the conduct of the hospital.\u00a0 In the absence of an organized governing body, there must be written documentation that identifies the individual or individuals that are legally responsible for the conduct of the hospital operations. If the hospital is part of a healthcare system that includes several separately certified hospitals, each with its own Medicare provider agreement and CMS Certification Number, the governing body of the healthcare system has the option to act as the governing body of each separately certified hospital, unless doing so would conflict with State law.\u00a0 A hospital system also has the option to form several governing bodies, each of which is responsible for several separately certified hospitals.\u00a0 For example, a health system operating hospitals in many States might choose to form regional sub-boards each responsible for the hospitals in its region, or a health system that has a mixture of types of hospitals may choose to form one sub-board responsible for its short-term acute care hospitals and another for its long term care hospitals. When deciding whether or not to exercise the option to have a single governing body for multiple hospitals in the system, another factor for systems to consider might be Medicare payment requirements at \u00a7\u00a7412.22(e) - (h) applicable to certain types of hospitals, i.e., non-grandfathered\u00a0 Hospitals-within-Hospitals and Hospital Satellites.\u00a0 In such cases where the hospital system owns both the tenant and the host hospital, using a single governing body for both hospitals would jeopardize the payment status of a hospital that is being paid by Medicare under a payment system excluded from the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS).\u00a0 However, surveyors do not assess compliance with or enforce the Medicare payment regulations that govern Hospitals-within-Hospitals or Hospital Satellites. The Medicare program offers hospital facilities considerable flexibility regarding how they choose to participate.\u00a0 Based on the geographic and other institutional limitations set out in the \u201cprovider-based\u201d regulation at \u00a7413.65, which addresses provider-based status for hospital facilities in multiple locations, hospital governing bodies make business decisions about how they want to participate in Medicare, and they indicate on their Medicare enrollment application the choices they have made.\u00a0 It is not uncommon to find multiple hospital campuses with one owner located in the same geographic area enrolled in Medicare as one hospital.\u00a0 It is also not uncommon to see a hospital system choosing to enroll its various facilities as separately certified hospitals.\u00a0 Various factors enter into consideration when the governing body of a system makes these decisions. For example, some governing bodies prefer to enroll various campuses as separate hospitals, out of a concern that problems at one hospital\u2019s campus might jeopardize the Medicare participation of the other campuses if they were a multi-campus hospital covered under one Medicare provider agreement.\u00a0 In other cases a governing body may see the benefits of integrating clinical services on multiple campuses into one integrated hospital.\u00a0 In still other cases, the deciding factor might be the implications for Medicare reimbursement of graduate medical education, the ease of adding satellite locations, etc. CMS defers to the governing bodies of hospitals to weigh the pertinent factors and permissible options, and to make business decisions in their best interest when applying to participate in Medicare.\u00a0 CMS\u2019s hospital certification decisions and issuance of a provider agreement and associated CCN follow from these business decisions by a hospital\u2019s governing body.\u00a0 But once the \u201chospital,\u201d with whatever component parts, has been certified, that hospital must independently demonstrate its compliance with the CoPs, independent of any other facility.\u00a0 (77 FR 29040, May 16, 2012) If a hospital system has chosen to have a one body act as the governing body for multiple separately certified hospitals (i.e., a system governing body), this does not alter the fact that each hospital must independently demonstrate compliance with the CoPs.\u00a0 Examples of what this means include, but are not limited to, the following: \u2022 Each separately certified hospital must be separately and independently assessed for its compliance with the CoPs, through either State Survey Agency or approved Medicare hospital accreditation program surveys.\u00a0\u00a0 There is no survey of a hospital \u201csystem,\u201d since the Medicare provider agreement and its terms are specific to each certified hospital. \u2022 A system governing body may wish to adopt identical policies and procedures for many aspects of a hospital\u2019s operations across all of its hospitals within the system.\u00a0 It has the flexibility to do so, but the documentation of such policies and procedures must be clear that the governing body has chosen to apply them to specifically named hospitals. Also, each hospital must be able to present for inspection the system governing body policies and procedures that clearly apply to that hospital.\u00a0 For example: A document that says \u201cXX Healthsystem has adopted the following policy\u201d is not acceptable.\u00a0 Instead, the document must be more specific, such as, \u201cXX Healthsystem adopts the following policy and procedure for Hospital A, Hospital B, and Hospital C.\u201d\u00a0 Furthermore, the names of each hospital (Hospitals A, B, and C in this example) must correspond to the names used for their provider agreements.\u00a0 For example, if Hospital C is one Medicare-certified hospital with two inpatient campuses, one called \u201cEast\u201d and one called \u201cWest,\u201d it is not acceptable for the policy document to state, \u201cXX Healthsystem adopts the following policy and procedure for Hospital A, Hospital B, and Hospital East and Hospital West.\u201d\u00a0 It would be acceptable to state, \u201cXX Healthsystem adopts the following policy and procedure for Hospital A, Hospital B, and Hospital C.\u201d It also is not acceptable for the policy document to state, \u201cXX Healthsystem adopts the following policy and procedure for Hospital A, Hospital B, and Hospital East, but not Hospital West.\u201d\u00a0 Since \u201cHospitals\u201d East and West refer to separate campuses of Hospital C, which participates in Medicare as one multicampus hospital, it is not appropriate to refer to these separate campuses of C as \u201chospitals,\u201d since the XX Healthsystem made a business decision to enroll them as parts of one multi-campus hospital in Medicare.\u00a0\u00a0 CMS recognizes that, depending on the particular policy topic, it may be acceptable to have policies that vary by type of unit/department within a hospital.\u00a0 The system governing body could achieve this as follows:\u00a0 \u201cXX Healthsystem adopts the following policy and procedure requiring that a physician be on-site 24 hours per day, seven days per week on the inpatient campuses of Hospital A and Hospital B, but within Hospital C, only for the East inpatient campus.\u201d \u2022 Likewise, the minutes of the governing body must be written in such a manner so that it is clear when the governing body has taken actions that apply to a specific certified hospital. \u2022 Departments of separately certified hospitals with one system governing body cannot be operationally integrated.\u00a0 For example, if a system has chosen to operate three separately certified hospitals in relatively close proximity to each other rather than to have them certified as one multi-campus hospital, then each hospital must have its own nursing service.\u00a0 It may not have one integrated nursing service with one Director of Nursing who manages one nursing staff for all three hospitals.\u00a0 The system cannot maintain one integrated schedule that assigns nursing staff among the different hospitals.\u00a0 The system also cannot move them back and forth between hospitals on an ad hoc, as needed basis, as if they were one hospital. On the other hand, the policies and procedures the governing body has adopted for the nursing service in each hospital may be identical, so long as the services operate separately.\u00a0 It is also permissible for the same individual to be the Director of Nursing for each hospital, provided that he or she is able to carry out all of the duties of the position in each hospital, such as managing each hospital's separate nursing staff.\u00a0 It is also permissible for one nurse to work at multiple hospitals within the system, in the same way that a nurse may work for multiple hospitals that do not share ownership, but the nurse must have separate work schedules for each hospital.\u00a0 Such schedules cannot overlap. \u2022 Likewise, although the system may choose to operate a quality assessment/performance improvement (QAPI) program at the system level which standardizes indicators measured across system hospitals, each separately-certified hospital in the system must have a QAPI program that is specific to that hospital.\u00a0 This is required not only to demonstrate compliance, but also for the governing body to function effectively, since reviewing QAPI program results only at the system level would make it difficult for the governing body to identify and act upon problems that are localized to one hospital. For example, the system may choose to use the same quality indicators or the same methodology to track adverse events across all system hospitals.\u00a0 But each certified hospital must have its own QAPI data with respect to these indicators and adverse events.\u00a0 If a system is tracking readmission rates across all of its hospitals, it must be able to separate out the hospital-specific results for the governing body\u2019s review and possible action. The governing body must be functioning effectively and holds the ultimate responsibility for the hospital\u2019s compliance not only with the specific standards of the governing body CoP, but also with all of the CoPs.\u00a0 This is the case regardless of whether the regulatory text for a particular condition or standard within a condition specifically mentions responsibilities of the governing body.\u00a0 Substantial, i.e., condition-level, non-compliance with one of the other hospital CoPs may be an indicator that the governing body is not functioning effectively.\u00a0 However, it is not the policy of CMS that condition-level noncompliance with any other CoP automatically results in a condition-level citation of the governing body CoP.\u00a0 Surveyors must consider whether the manner and degree of the other deficiencies provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the governing body is not functioning effectively. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.12 \u2022 Verify that the hospital has an organized governing body or has written documentation that identifies the individual or individuals that are responsible for the conduct of the hospital operations. \u2022 If the hospital is part of a hospital system which uses one governing body for several of the hospital\u2019s separately certified within the system: \u2022 Review the governing body minutes to determine if it is clear which actions pertain to which hospitals. \u2022 Select for review several policy and procedure documents adopted by the system governing body to determine if it is clear that they apply to the hospital being surveyed.",

Guidance \u00a7482.62 The purpose of this Condition of Participation is to ensure that the psychiatric hospital is adequately staffed with qualified mental health professionals and supportive staff to carry out an intensive and comprehensive active treatment program and to protect and promote the physical and mental health of the patients. Through observation, interview and record review determine if numbers and/or deployment of qualified staff is a concern. Review incident reports, medication error reports, patient and staff injury reports, for indications that staffing is an issue. Adequate numbers are defined to mean the numbers, and deployment, of staff with qualifications to evaluate, plan, implement and document active treatment. Do not look at numbers alone. The hospital is responsible for organizing its available staff and administrative duties along with patient appointments, treatment plan meetings, treatment sessions, activities, materials, equipment and patient assignments to wards and groups in such a way that results in patients achieving the maximum therapeutic benefit. Survey Procedure \u00a7482.62 Assess the adequacy of the Special Staffing Condition by: 1. Observing sampled patients and others during structured sessions and in unstructured settings. You should be able to observe behavioral evidence of a rational organization of resources. 2. Next, interview patients and staff to determine whether or not necessary treatment modalities and other services are being provided in a timely manner. 3. Next review the medical records of patients in the sample to ascertain if necessary active treatment assessments, treatments, evaluations and activities have been conducted and documented. 4. Also, review other records such as restraint and seclusion records, incident reports, medication error reports, reports of patient/staff injuries, etc., to determine the extent to which staffing levels or deployment contributed to negative patient outcomes. 5. Evaluate all outcome data in light of the success or failure observed during the survey relevant to each patient receiving active treatment, and achieving desired outcomes of care. This is the primary basis for evaluating the adequacy of the hospital\u2019s staffing under this Special Condition.",

These differ from review eligibility criteria in that the certification process may be initiated even when all CPRs have not yet been met. For an organization seeking certification for the first time, compliance with the CPRs is assessed during the initial review. For the certified program, compliance with these requirements is assessed throughout the certification cycle through on-site reviews, Evidence of Standards Compliance (ESC), and periodic updates of organization-specific data and information. Organizations are either compliant or not compliant with CPRs. When an organization does not comply with a CPR, the organization generally will be assigned a Requirement for Improvement (RFI) similar to noncompliance with a standard. However, refusal to permit performance of an unscheduled or unannounced for-cause review (CPR 3) or falsification of information (CPR 7) will immediately lead to a decision of Not Certified. Any RFI can potentially impact the certification decision and follow-up requirements, as determined by established certification decision rules listed in \u201cThe Joint Commission Certification Process\u201c (CERT) chapter. Failure to resolve an RFI has the potential to lead to loss of certification.",

They must also have a thorough understanding of their patient population so that the care they provide is relevant to their population\u2019s needs. The standards in this chapter focus on the following: - Designing and implementing the program - Evaluating the program - Offering a relevant program for patients - Providing safe and adequate access to care - Conducting the program in an ethical manner - Supplying reference resources to practitioners - Offering the program in safe and accessible facilities Please note that not all standards or elements of performance apply to every disease-specific care program. For example, disease management service providers may facilitate or support care by telephone interventions but may not have a physical site where patients are seen or gathered. In these cases, the facility standards may not apply. Each disease-specific care program should consider its individual circumstances and services.",

Patients with a chronic disease count on practitioners to provide the best care possible. Of course, delivering or facilitating high-quality care means that practitioners are constantly striving to improve. Therefore, the standards in this chapter focus on the following: - Using qualified, competent practitioners - Delivering or facilitating the delivery of care using evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) - Individualizing care to meet patients\u2019 needs - Managing comorbidities and concurrently occurring conditions - Initiating discharge planning and facilitating subsequent care, treatment, and services These activities require an interdisciplinary approach. Each practitioner\u2019s role and responsibilities are determined by his or her professional skills, competence, and credentials; the care provided; and the program\u2019s policies. Note: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are found in the literature under many names\u2014practice parameters, practice guidelines, patient care protocols, standards of practice, clinical pathways, care maps, and so forth. In all cases, CPGs should be evidence based and effective for the targeted patient populations.",

Over time, patients may receive a range of care in multiple settings from multiple practitioners. The goal of coordinating information across the continuum of care is to manage information so that care is maximized as well as improved. For this reason the disease-specific care program should understand its role within a health care delivery system that spans across settings, services, practitioners, and care levels. Because the continuum of care encompasses such a large scope of people and services, disease-specific care programs must maintain the integrity and security of their data and information as they compile and share it with others. The standards in this chapter focus on the following: - Proactively gathering and sharing information across the continuum to coordinate care across settings and over time - Providing easy access to patient-related information - Preserving confidentiality of patient information - Maintaining data quality and integrity - Integrating and interpreting data from various sources - Using aggregate data to support the program's information needs and direction setting Although efficiency may be improved by computerization and other technologies, the principles of good information management apply to all processes, whether paper based or electronic.",
